# US-Big-4-Sports-Analysis
As part of 'Introduction to Data Science with Python' course,4 assigment, this code calculates with 4 functions an statistical Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the win/loss ratio of the 4 big Sports (NHL,MLB,MBA,NFL) of US and the team´s city population. Given 2 or more teams in the same city it makes an average over all teams of the city for that sport. 
The 5th function makes a dataframe with the t-test statistic analysis of all pairs of sports to explore the hypothesis that given that an area has two sports teams in different sports, those teams will perform the same within their respective sports.

All the functions are in the 'Assigment 4.py' document and the data is in the 'assets' file.
